# Build Your Own World

This project generates a map using Kruskal's algorithm to create a minimum spanning tree that connects various rooms. Additional elements such as coins and light sources are placed on the map. The A* algorithm is then employed to find the shortest path to collect the coins.

## Features

- **Map Generation:** 
  - Utilizes Kruskal's algorithm to generate a minimum spanning tree.
  - Connects all rooms efficiently with the least number of connections.
  
- **Element Placement:** 
  - Adds coins, light sources, and other components to the map.

- **Pathfinding:**
  - Implements the A* algorithm to calculate the shortest path to reach the coins.
